# thumbnailer

A script to help you generate thumbnails for your file manager manually. It tries to follow the Freedesktop.org specification and should work for the file managers following it.

Will crawl directories recursively and can skip exsisting thumbnails.

This can also be useful for troubleshooting thumbnail generation.
